## How to talk to me

**Always explain in easy, plain language.** This is the most important rule here
and it applies to every single answer, not just the ones that look complicated.

- No jargon. If a technical term is unavoidable, say what it means in the same
  breath, in normal words.
- Short sentences. Short paragraphs.
- Lead with the plain-English answer. The code details come after, and only if
  they are actually needed.
- Explain things the way you would to a smart person who does not already know
  this codebase.
- Do not hide behind class names, method names, and log lines. Say what is
  actually happening and why the user would notice it.

Bad: "The `pauseAllExcept` future never resolves because the platform channel
reply is dropped when the codec is reclaimed."

Good: "The app waits for the old video to stop before starting the new one.
Sometimes the old video never reports back that it stopped, so the app waits
forever and the new video never starts."

Same rule for commit messages, PR descriptions, and code comments: plain and
direct.
